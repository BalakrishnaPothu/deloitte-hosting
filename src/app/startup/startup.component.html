            <div class="headline">SpeQtral and Arquimea Announce Strategic MOU to Advance Quantum Secure Solutions and Satellite Technologies   | <em class="date">20th March 2024</em></div>
            <div class="detail">SpeQtral is a Singapore-based startup specialising in quantum communications solutions, merging space-based transmission with terrestrial fibre for the global delivery of secure encryption keys. One of the products in their short-term pipeline is a quantum satellite that would incorporate these secure encryption keys. Recently in Mar 2024, they signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Arquimea, a leading space technology provider headquartered in Spain. Their collaborative efforts include the exploration of potential quantum secure solutions compatible with the BeetleSat Constellation, and the exploration of joint business opportunities in Europe and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.</div>
            <div class="impact">
                <p>SpeQtral deals with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) that sends encrypted data over networks. QKD is better than traditional forms of encryption because unlike classical encryption, which relies on mathematical complexity and can be vulnerable to hacking, quantum communication utilizes qubits that are highly sensitive to any attempt at interception. The use of qubits in QKD ensures that any eavesdropping attempt would disrupt the quantum state of the particles, alerting the sender and recipient to potential security breaches. This level of security is unmatched by classical encryption methods, making quantum communication a more robust and secure option for transmitting sensitive information.</p>
                <p>The satellites as manufactured and distributed by Arquimea play a crucial role in quantum communication by enabling global secure communication through QKD technology, allowing for the transmission of encrypted keys over long distances without compromising security.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="impact">This entry covers the SEA research area for startup development and combines several up-and-coming topics: Space as well as Quantum Communications. It also indicates interest and demand not just in APAC but also in EU for acquiring advanced quantum secure communication capabilities and the potential of the space sector to facilitate such research.</div>
            <div class="startup-capability">SpeQtral specializes in quantum communication technology. Their core capabilities revolve around harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to develop secure, high-speed communication systems that are resistant to eavesdropping and hacking attempts.</div>

                <div class="detail">A Japanese startup named Astroscale successfully launched a satellite in February 2024 to survey the state of a jettisoned rocket section in orbit in space, in hoping to be a first-mover in developing technology for space debris removal. Founded in 2013 and having last raised US$76 million series G funding in February 2023, the startup specializes in creating solutions relating to on-orbit servicing, including life extension, in-space situational awareness, end of life, and active debris removal. Their main mandate is to create sustainable space systems and mitigate the growing and hazardous build-up of debris in space in recent years, in line with the increase in launches of satellites and rockets.</div>
                <div class="impact">Astroscale is also in talks to go public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange by June 2024, adding to the ranks of publicly listed Japanese spacetech firms, of which there are currently 2 (iQPS and Ispace). In terms of product market fit, existing space junk such as defunct satellites and ejected rocket sections raise the risk of collisions with active satellites, and there is no established method to remove the debris. Astroscale's research and development therefore helps to ensure the sustainability of the space-exploration endeavor.</div>
