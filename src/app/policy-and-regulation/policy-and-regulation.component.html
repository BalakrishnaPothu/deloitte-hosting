            <div class="detail">
                <p> The U.S. has been concerned about Russia potentially creating and deploying an anti-satellite nuclear weapon. While Russia is reportedly moving forward in its attempt to develop a new nuclear capability in space, some who are familiar with the issue say it is not poised to deploy such a device in the immediate future.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="impact">
                If successful, this could potentially violate the Outer Space Treaty, which prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons or other kinds of weapons of mass destruction into space. Could present a pressing need to reasses multilateral laws and regulations on space defense.

                <p>The Commercial Standards Paramount to Accelerating Cosmic Exploration (SPACE) Leadership Act would extend the learning period by five years, improving the ability of the authorities to enact regulations for the safety of occupants on commercial spacecraft.</p>
                <p>The second bill directs authorities to streamline the commercial launch licensing process by incorporating industry input.</p>

            <div class="impact">
                The overall aim of the two bills is to cut red tape to make commercial space launches and licensing processes more efficient. The private and commercial space industry seems to welcome the progress on this front as it would allow them to drive and provide input on future commercial human space flight regulations, and improve innovation and competitiveness in space.

                <p>The main aim of the Act is to direct specific agencies to conduct active debris remediation or removal of human-made space objects that are no longer in use and can harm orbiting satellites and on-orbit activities.

                Clients who have the technology to aid the agencies in the remediation could potentially submit proposals to NASA once the demonstration program is launched.

                <p>At present, Thailand has not enacted a comprehensive national space law to regulate space affairs and activities in support of its space sector. Such affairs include the registration of space objects and the management of accidents in space. However, Thailand does have agencies that cover such matters, the most significant of which is the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA), a government agency assigned by the Cabinet of Thailand (the Cabinet) to manage space affairs and activities. The GISTDA does not oversee or establish centralized, comprehensive policies and regulations.</p>
                <p>In addition, Thailand has a presence in space with its own satellites for telecommunications and the exploration of natural resources. Various agencies have been (or will be) established that are responsible for satellite-related affairs, for example, the GISTDA and the National Space Policy Committee (NSPC).</p>
