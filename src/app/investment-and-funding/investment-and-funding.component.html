            <div class="detail">
                <p>The Ministry of Communication and Informatics is leading the development of the Satria-2 satellite, aiming for a capacity of 300 Gbps. This ambitious project is entirely financed by foreign investment, with an estimated budget of US$ 860 million (IDR 13 trillion). Discussions regarding technical aspects are ongoing with key government agencies such as the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) and the Ministry of Finance. The decision on whether the satellite will operate in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) or Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is pending. Once operational, the satellite's internet services will benefit various sectors including education, healthcare, government services, security, and tourism. Procurement is scheduled to begin in 2025, building upon the success of the Satria-1 satellite launched in 2023. The orbit scheme for Satria-2 will be determined through a competitive tendering process, involving satellite companies such as Satelit Nusantara Tiga (SNT).</p>

                <p>The United States is embroiled in a multi-billion dollar space race with China and Russia, focusing on military satellite technology for communication, jamming, tracking, and surveillance. As part of this effort, the US is pressuring its allies, including New Zealand, to contribute more funding to a $1.6 billion project to launch two powerful new military satellites. New Zealand currently relies on aging US satellites and has only committed $15 million towards launching one of the replacements.</p>

The government is hesitant to boost defense spending, particularly in light of the current economic climate. Contributing more to the US project would solidify New Zealand's alignment with the US and its military interests. However, developing its own independent space capabilities would lessen reliance on the US but likely come at a significantly higher cost.
